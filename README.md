# ClickBot5000
This is a "clicking robot" done pretty simply in Java. Its purpose was to "help" me play some of the flash idle game
that seem to require a lot of clicking rapidly in the same space.

So all this does is click a lot wherever you want it to. But it does it kind of nicely. Bring up the app, then click 
on the big button to get it started. It waits for your mouse to settle (graphically showing its countdown) and when
the mouse is settled, starts clicking as rapidly as it can. When you move the mouse a few pixels away, it stops and
re-waits for the mouse to settle, or you can click the button to stop it.

Pretty simple! But I also was able to take this base code and expand it into being able to play a click-reaction game
by monitoring areas of the screen and moving the mouse and clicking it with this tool
